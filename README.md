### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Thanos, a passionate software engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset. For the past 10 years I have been creating and managing engineering teams on early stage startups, helping them grow from zero to ten. The previous 10+ years I've been founding companies, writting open source code and working for startups as an engineer.
